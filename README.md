## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

Create a .env file in the project's root directory. If you don't specify a PORT in the .env file, the default port will be set to 3000. Example:
    
    # Example .env file
    PORT=3000

    npm run dev

Test the default route by accessing:

    
    GET http://localhost:3000/

Run the following command to execute the test suite:

    npm test

The setup includes Jest for testing and SuperTest for API testing.
